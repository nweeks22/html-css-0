        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <h2>This is a subheader</h2>
            <p><i> whats up fellas</i> This is another paragraph</p>
        <h3> This is the <i> 3rd</i> header </h3>
            <p> Einstein proposed the formula E=mc<sup>2</sup>!</p>
        <h4> This is the 4th header tag</h4>
        <br> The formula for water is h<sup>2</sup>0<br>
        <h2> <ul> <li>  Eggs: Eggs add moisture and act as a binding agent, which means they help hold the dough together. </li>
            <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.</li> 
            <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise. </li>
           <li> Water: A bit of hot water creates steam as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the cookies up. </li>
           <li> Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies taste salty.</li>
           <li> Flour: All-purpose flour helps create gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough. </li>
           <li>Chocolate chips: Of course, you'll need semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk chocolate chips if you prefer.</li>
           <li>Nuts (optional): Walnuts are optional, but they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.</li></ul></h2>
